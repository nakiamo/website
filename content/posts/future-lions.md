# Imagining the Future
In collaboration with Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Future Lions is the annual worldwide competition that challenges students to create the future. The brief of the competition is simple:

> Connect an audience of your choosing to a product or service from a global brand in a way that wasn’t possible three years ago.  

The main focus of my “Advertising Project” lecture is on the future consumer and technology trends. One of the outputs of this lecture is Future Lions competition entries created by the students. Here are some good examples of the projects my students created.

Our new book chapter with Sezgin Ate≈ü "Data Privacy in Digital Advertising: Towards a Post Third-Party Cookie Era" is published as a part of the new book series from Routledge: "Algorithms and Society". The chapter analyzes the methods by which user behaviors are tracked online for the delivery of personalized advertising and have their personal data commodified in the marketplace. The technologies employed inevitably lead to privacy violations and regulations often do not keep up with the fast pace of these technical developments which allow for ever more effective web tracking and surveillance.

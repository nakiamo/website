I give theoretical and prectical lessons on advertising which is in a constant state of flux. Therefore, I always try to update the content of my courses to stay relevant. Emerging technologies, current consumer trends, transformations in the media landscape, are always at the core of my lectures. 
Our students need to master new skills to guarantee a successful career in the media and data science is definetly one of those skılls. I belive that having a basic knowledge about data science will not only be an extra skill on their cv but opens a new wındow to explore their potential. 

Therefore, I'm using DataCamp for the Classroom to help students learn data science anywhere, any time. @DataCamp provides access to world-class online education for free via this initiative. Find out more: https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education

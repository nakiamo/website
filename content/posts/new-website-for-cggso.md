I created a web site for "Cultural Studies & Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Graduate Student Organization" at the University of Pittsburgh. 

### [https://cggso.netlify.app](https://cggso.netlify.app) ###

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the static website generator. The free [Winston Theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme) was the right choice for the content. The student organziation organizes an annual graduate student conference so they needed a simple and effective conference schedule embedded on the website. After searching for the free and paid alternatives, I found out [Time.ly](https://time.ly) provides all the things we needed in their free plan. 

I use Visual Studio Code to generate, update websites with Hugo and push-pull to Github but the organization needed a simple and effective CMS (content management system) for easily updating the website through an interface. I used [Forestry](https://forestry.io) as the CMS becasuse it supports both Hugo and Github, and has a clean interface. I finally hosted the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I belive this is one of the best ways to create an effective and secure website without spending any money!

This [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ResipmZmpDU) briefly explains how to Integrate your Hugo website with Forestry and Netlify.
